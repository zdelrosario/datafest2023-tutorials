# Setup: RStudio

*Purpose*: We're going to make extensive use of the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html); in particular, the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages. This first exercise will guide you through setting up the necessary software.

*Reading*: (None)

*Note*: If you're reading this file in RStudio, you can Shift + Click (Mac: CMD + Click) to follow a link.

### __q1__ Install Rstudio

Download [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and install the [R programming language](https://cran.rstudio.com/). Both are free!

Once you have installed RStudio, you can download the tutorial files from [this link](https://download-directory.github.io?url=https://github.com/zdelrosario/datafest2023-tutorials/tree/main/tutorials). Open this file (`00-install-assignment.Rmd`) in Rstudio. This is an `R Markdown` file, which is a combination of human-readable text and machine-readable code. Think of it as a modern take on a lab notebook.

### __q2__ Install packages

Next, run RStudio. When the program opens, you should see a console tab, as in
the image below.

![RStudio console](./images/rstudio-console.png)

Note that RStudio has multiple tabs, including the `Console`, `Terminal`, `Jobs`, and any files you may have opened. Make sure you are in the `Console` tab.

Type the line `install.packages("tidyverse")` in your `Console` and press Enter. This will start the installation of the `tidyverse` package, which we will use extensively in this class.

### __q3__ Test your install

Once your installation has finished, return to your console and use the command `library(tidyverse)`. If your installation is complete, this command should return a list of packages and version numbers, similar to the image below.

![RStudio package install](./images/rstudio-cli-library.png)

If you have any issues with installation, __please__ let me know!

### __q4__ Download cheatsheets

The `tidyverse` is essentially a language built on top of R. As such, there are a lot of functions to remember. To that end, the RStudio folks have put together a number of [cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) to reference when doing data science. Some of the most important ones are:

*Note* These cheatsheet URLs update frequently, so the links might be broken. If these don't work, try searching the web for "Tidyverse cheat sheets."

- [Data transformation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
- [Data importing](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)

Later, we will learn special tools for handling other types of data. The following cheatsheets will be useful for those:

- [String data](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)
- [Dates and times](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/lubridate.pdf)
- [Factors](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/factors.pdf)
- [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
