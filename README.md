# datafest2023-tutorials

This is the repository for the Babson-Olin-Wellesley (BOW) DataFest 2023 tutorials! We will host a live introduction to data science in R at Olin College on the opening night of DataFest.

To get ready for DataFest, please follow [this link](https://github.com/zdelrosario/datafest2023-tutorials/blob/main/solutions/00-install-solution.md) and follow the installation instructions. This will set up your computer to do data science using the R programming language. If any of the installation instructions do not work, you can ask us questions during the tutorials.
